# Touch Point Identification for Capacitive Heatmaps

Algorithm prototyping for robust detection of touch points from capacitive heatmaps as input data.
Intended for use in https://github.com/linux-surface/intel-precise-touch/.

See the [jupyter notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/qzed/touch-detection-prototype/blob/master/prototype.ipynb) for details.
