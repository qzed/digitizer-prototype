# Prototyping for Pen and Touch Digitizer input Processing

Algorithm prototyping for pen/stylus and touch digitizer input processing.
Intended for use in https://github.com/linux-surface/intel-precise-touch/.
Contains multiple topics:

- Prototyping for robust detection of touch points from capacitive heatmaps as input data: [touch-extraction.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/qzed/digitizer-prototype/blob/master/touch-extraction.ipynb).
