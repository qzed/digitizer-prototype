    "# Pre-Filtering for Gaussian Fitting\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in the touch-extraction notebook, we can use a 2D Gaussian distribution to represent a touch point.\n",
    "The coordinate of this point is given by its mean $\\mu$, while the contact area, described by an ellipse, is derived from its covariance matrix $\\Sigma$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The usual caveat applies, however: This only ever works well if the data fits (at least somewhat) to our model.\n",
    "We can expect this to be the case for finger tips (round-ish in shape, with a single local maximum), but in reality not only fingers will touch the screen.\n",
    "When writing, for example, the palm will likely touch the screen.\n",
    "When lifting the tablet, the hands might cause accidental touches at the side.\n",
    "Both of which may (in case of writing quite likely) not match a Gaussian, e.g. be convex and have multiple local maximas in the same connected area.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under these conditions, the previously explored Gaussian fitting approach will break down, leading to undesired inputs.\n",
    "We could now try to extend the algorithm so that it might be able to handle arbitrary shapes, but that then directly begs the question of how one should parametrize arbitrary shapes.\n",
    "This would also come with the problem of how one should attempt to solve for those parameters, especially considering that we deal with inherently noisy data, as it is likely that there is no closed form solution for this problem.\n",
    "Thus we, for now, consider this problem ill-posed (since we don't have such a parametrization) and will focus on a different idea:\n",
    "Pre-filtering the input data so that only Gaussian-like objects remain."

    "\n",
    "Now that we have an overview of some metrics and measures applied to actual input data (albeit expected to special and uncommon), we can lay out our plan forward:\n",
    "The basic idea is to start off by detecting individual parts of the heatmap image, i.e. objects.\n",

    "### Object Detection and Labeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that for object detection, we want to also separate connected components that may overlap in the input heatmap image.\n",
    "This, specifically, is why we've looked at the ridge measure above.\n",
    "Combined with the pre-processed heatmap image, this measure will be used to determine the connected components that make up this image by first deciding which pixels belong to objects (via what we will refer to as the objective measure), and then labeling those objects by analyzing the connections between individual pixels of which they are made up.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the objective measure, we rely on a simple blending formula with one coefficient per input image/measure, i.e. $o = \\omega_{h} \\cdot h - \\omega_{r} \\cdot r$, where $h$ is the pre-processed heatmap, $r$ the ridge measure as defined above, and $\\omega_{h}, \\omega_{r} > 0$ their respective weights.\n",
    "Note that we subtract the ridge measure here as we essentially want to downweigh the objective score for any pixel that is likely on the boundary between two components, i.e. on a ridge. Also note that this mixing function itself can be seen as parameter to be exchanged with arbitrarily complex parametrizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this objective measure defined, we can then consider every pixel $x$ with a score over a certain threshold $\\varrho < o(x)$ to be part of an object."

    "A fairly simple idea for this is considering the pixels $x_c$ of the core components as identified above as parts with a weight of $w(x_c, l_c) = 1$ for the particular component $c$ and $w(x_c, l_p) = 0$ for any other component $p \\neq c$.\n",
    "We then compute the (non-normalized) weight $\\tilde{w}(x, l)$ for any non-component pixel $x$ and label $l$ based on its distance $d(x, l)$ (either euclidean or, better, based on some measure) to the nearest pixel with that label.\n",
    "After normalizing the weights, so that all weights at a pixel sum up to one ($w_l = \\tilde{w}_l\\,/\\, \\sum_k{\\tilde{w}_k}$), we can compute the individual decompositions $h_l$ by multiplying the weight $w_l$ of the respective label $l$ with the pre-processed heatmap $h$, i.e. $h_l = w_l \\cdot h$.\n",
    "Note that this fulfills $h = \\sum_l h_l \\cdot w_l$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve this process, we use a weighted distance transform.\n",
    "Instead of simply considering the euclidean distance, we can, with that, compute distance weights based on the gradient and ridge measure (or other measures, e.g. alignment of walking direction with gradient may be better), where parts with higher gradient and ridge measure incur more cost.\n",
    "This means that walking along a smooth path will incur less cost, thus expanding influence along e.g. slow declines, whereas walking over strong declines and increases incurs a higher cost, meaning we achieve a better separation along ridges, which, again, we assume separate different components.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the non-normalized weights $\\tilde{w}$, we rely on a Gaussian approach, i.e. $w_l(x) = \\exp\\left((-d(x, l)/\\sigma\\right)^2)$ with parameter $\\sigma$, which should fit well with our assumption that finger-tips are (remotely) Gaussian shaped.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in the code below, we combine several labels to reduce the number of decompositions.\n",
    "For our ultimate goal, filtering out non-Gaussian-shaped components, we only need two decompositions: included and excluded components."
